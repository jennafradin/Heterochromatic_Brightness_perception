# Heterochromatic brightness and luminance

## Main objective 

Although it is natural to imagine that sensations of **brightness** are direct representations of the **luminance**, the amount of light returned to the eye from an object and the experience of brightness it engenders are related only indirectly in a way that is not yet understood

It has been known for a while now that Heterochromatic brightness perception deviates markedly from luminance, this is illustrated by the Helmholtz-Kolrausch effect:

Chromatic patches appear brighter than achromatic patches of equal luminance and hue also has an effect on brightness perception.

A number of color appearance models attempt to account for this but they were either computationally complex or have been rejected for non-additivity.

The goal was to propose a simple non-linear model to account for this difference of perception.
